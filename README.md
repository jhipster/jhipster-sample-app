jhipster-sample-app
===================

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/jhipster/jhipster-sample-app/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/jhipster/jhipster-sample-app/latest)

This is a sample application created with [JHipster](https://github.com/jdubois/generator-jhipster).

It is created with all the default settings.

If you want to run the app, it's as simple as using Maven:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Of course, if you are a true Java hipster, you should use the [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/jdubois/generator-jhipster)!
