jhipster-sample-app
===================

This is a sample application created with [jhipster](https://github.com/jdubois/generator-jhipster).

It is created with all the default settings.

If you want to run the app, it's as simple as using Maven:

```bash
mvn jetty:run

Of course, if you are a true hipster, you should use the [Yeoman genarator](https://github.com/jdubois/generator-jhipster)!
